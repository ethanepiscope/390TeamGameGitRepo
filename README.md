**Game Pitch:** 

You know those horror movies where the plot-armored main characters very slowly
open the creaking door or trip when they are right about to make it to safety? None of that will fly
here, as one flinch, one brash movement, even one small mistake means it lights out for good. If
you are attacked or your candle light goes out, it's game over for you.

**How to Play:**

● In the starting screen, the player must press the spacebar in order to progress through
the beginning story

● The player moves using the WASD keys OR the arrow keys and can look around their
environment using the mouse

● The player is able to pick up a candle in one hand early on in the game to navigate the
map; if the player moves the mouse too quickly or runs into an obstacle, the candle will
go out and the game is over.

● The player can hide in closets/wardrobes hidden around the map, and this will prevent
the monster from reaching them

● The player’s other hand is free to interact with objects in their environment using the E
key; the player is only able to hold one more item besides their candle.

● The player is able to press the shift key in order to move faster/sprint, but this comes
with the cost of depleting the candle more rapidly

● Navigate the map and figure out how to escape the house; do not get caught by the
monster roaming the halls.

**Amount & Type of Content Available:**

● Player is able to hold the candle, and stepping on glass obstacles will cause this candle
to decrease in size until there is no light left, ending the game

● Player can hide from the monster through multiple closets scattered around the house,
which will cause the enemy AI to not be aggressive towards the player

● A 2D mini game puzzle to unlock further areas/items in the map (broken glass puzzle)

● Win the game by exiting through the correct door

**Lessons Learned:**

● Game design takes a really long time, so it is best to have a clear plan and start with a
very small scope. We ran into issues of not being able to finish all that we intended in
time, so we all know in the future to think a lot smaller than our initial inclination when we
have a close deadline.

● Commit changes frequently and make sure to update your team about these changes;
there was a point where we overwrote some of our changes by not being careful, so for
next time we know to make sure we are doing the correct thing by checking in with the
rest of the team.

● Working on a team allows everyone to play to their strengths. Embrace the new
challenges and have fun in order to get the best experience!
